       Why? Because Minecraft's sound system was not made for this kind of thing, and this
       is the easiest way which:
       1. Produces a sound audible from a specifiable range.
       2. Produces a sound which decreases in volume the farther you get away from it.
       3. Doesn't completely spazz out the instant you try to actually use it.*/
